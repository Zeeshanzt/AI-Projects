# Fashion Items Classifier

## Data Source
  The Dataset was obtained from Keras Fashion MNIST datasets.
  
## Techniques/ Tools Used

### Tensorflow and Keras
  Both of them were used for data extraction ad model training.

### Normalization
  There is use of normalization for the feature scaling for better training of the model on training dataset.
  
### Convolutional and Sequential Neural Network
  There is use of 4 Layered Neural Netwrork containing MaxPool, Dropout, Dense and Flatten Layers for creating the classifier for the classification.
 
### Optimizer Function
  Adam optimizer was used for the auto tuning of hyper parameters during the training on the dataset.

### Data Visualization
  Use of Matplotlib and Numpy for the plotting of the validation set and training set losses.

## Results
  The trained model was working on 89% accuracy after training on the dataset.
