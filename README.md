# AI Projects
Overview
This repository contains various AI projects that have been implemented using Python programming language. These projects demonstrate the practical application of various machine learning algorithms and libraries including TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Keras.

## Projects
The following projects are included in this repository:

* Animal Classification
* Diabetes Predictor
* Fashion Items Classifier
* Finding Bias in Browsers Dataset
* Handwritten Digit Classifier
* House Prices Prediction
* Iris Classification
* Number Plate Recognizer
Each project has its own folder containing the necessary code and data files. A brief description of each project is given below:

### Animal Classification
This project involves using machine learning algorithms to classify different types of animals based on their characteristics.

### Diabetes Predictor
In this project, machine learning is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their medical history.

### Fashion Items Classifier
This project involves training a machine learning model to classify different fashion items such as shirts, pants, shoes, etc.

### Finding Bias in Browsers Dataset
This project involves analyzing a dataset to determine if there is any bias in how different web browsers handle certain types of requests.

### Handwritten Digit Classifier
In this project, machine learning is used to classify handwritten digits based on their images.

### House Prices Prediction
This project involves predicting the prices of houses based on various factors such as location, size, and amenities.

### Iris Classification
This project involves using machine learning algorithms to classify different types of irises based on their characteristics.

### Number Plate Recognizer
In this project, machine learning is used to recognize and read number plates from images or videos.
