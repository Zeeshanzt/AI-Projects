# Finding Bias in Different Browser Dataset based on Gender

## Data Source
  The Dataset was obtained from downloading 1000 images of all 10 nationalities from Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo.
  
## Techniques/ Tools Used

### OpenCV and DeepFace
  Both of them were used for data extraction and gender classification of the test data set images.

### Data Visualization
  Use of Matplotlib and Numpy for the plotting of the final results obtained for each nationality from different browsers. The code was automated to do all the plotting and storing the graphs as facts and figures in the drive.
  

## Results
  The results obtained were pretty accurate as there was much noise in the dataset, which was dealt using OPEN CV.
